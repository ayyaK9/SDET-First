 Docker is a computer programme that performs os level virtualization
 
 Docker is an containerization platform 
 we need to package all the pre reqs like java,chrome, sel standalone in to a container and ship in to any number of machines
 Create and run testcases using containers
 
 Container is like a new operating system
 
 IMAGE:
 
 Light wieght standalone executable package of software that includes everything needed to run automation
 
 Container should contains:
 JAVA, Sel jars, Chrome browser
 
 Alone container fails run =ning since it doesnot have pre reqs so we will create one image which contains packed pre req
 
 
 Deploy image in to a container
 
 
 Container is an run time instance of an image
 
 Class>> Image  ||| Object>>container
 
 
 DOCKER FILE:
 Instructions will be written in docker file >> to build docker image.
 
 Virtualization means creating a guest operating system in a host OS
 
 All the resources will be shared from host automatically as per need based unlike hypervisor (dynamic allocation)
 
 DOCKER HUB:
 to pull the image from client
